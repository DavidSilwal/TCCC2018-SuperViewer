# TCCC2018-SuperViewer
SuperViewer demo ASP.NET Core 2.0 application for Twin Cities Code Camp 2018

To run the code successfully, you probably need two things in place:
1. A SQL database with the table from the SuperViewer/SuperViewer/SqlTableDef/ErrorLogs.txt file created and some rows inserted into it.
1. The appSettings.json file should be updated with the connection string information to the database containing the table above, and a "Name" to represent the environment.


The PNG files in this repo are just some screenshots from the VSTS build and release definitions I set up to enable CI/CD.

The PPTX is the power point presentation is from the actual talk at TC Code Camp.
